(b) super junior .................. competitors who are under the age of 16 on the first day of the match.  a super junior has the option of electing to shoot in junior category, but not in both.  if there are insufficient competitors for super junior category to be recognized, all competitors registered in this category will automatically be transferred to junior category. (c) junior............................. competitors who are under the age of 21 on the first day of the match. (d) senior ............................ competitors who are over the age of 50 on the first day of the match. (e) super senior .................. competitors who are over the age of 60 on the first day of the match.  a super senior has the option of electing to shoot in senior category, but not in both.  if there are insufficient competitors for super senior category to be recognized, all competitors registered in this category will automatically be transferred to senior category. 4. team categories: ipsc matches may recognize the following for team awards: (a) regional teams by division. (b) regional teams by division for lady category. (c) regional teams by division for super junior category. (d) regional teams by division for junior category. (e) regional teams by division for senior category. (f) regional teams by division for super senior category. (g) regional teams by family. family teams consist of two members, one being a junior and the other either a parent or grandparent of the junior. notwithstanding rules 6.4.2 and 6.4.2.1, the two team members may compete in different divisions and a female individually registered as lady may participate as the junior provided that she satisfies the junior age limit. family team results will be calculated by adding the match percentiles attained by the two members."

					"SearchableString": "appendix c1:  calibration of ipsc action air poppers      1. the range master must designate a specific supply of projectiles and one or more firearms to be used as official calibration tools by officials authorized by him to serve as calibration officers.    2. the nominated firearms in the previous rule should be the least powerful available at the match.    3. once the designated projectiles and firearms have been approved by the range master, they are not subject to challenge by competitors.    4. the range master must arrange for each popper to be calibrated prior to commencement of a match, and whenever required during a match.    5. for initial calibration, each popper must be set to fall when hit within the calibration zone with a single shot fired from a designated firearm using the calibration projectiles.  the shot must be fired from the shooting location in the course of fire furthest from where at least part of the calibration zone of the popper being calibrated is visible to competitors.  calibration zones are indicated in the diagrams in the following pages.    6. if, during a course of fire, a popper does not fall when hit, a competitor has three alternatives:    (a) the popper is shot again until it falls.  in this case, no further action is required and the course of fire is scored  as shot .    (b) the popper is left standing but the competitor does not challenge the calibration.  in this case, no further action is required and the course of fire is scored  as shot , with the subject popper scored as a miss.    (c) the popper is left standing and the competitor challenges the calibration.  in this case, the popper and the surrounding area on which it stands must not be touched or interfered with by any person.  if a match official violates this rule, the competitor must reshoot the course of fire.  if the competitor or any other person violates this rule, the popper will be scored as a miss and the rest of the course of fire will be scored  as shot .    (d) if the popper falls for any other reason (e.g. wind action), before it can be calibrated, a reshoot must be ordered.    7. in the absence of any interference, a calibration officer must conduct a calibration test of the subject popper (when required under 6(c) above), from as near as possible to the point from where the competitor shot the popper, when the following will apply:    (a) if the first shot fired by the calibration officer hits the calibration zone or below and the popper falls, the popper is deemed to be properly calibrated, and it will be scored as a miss.    (b) if the first shot fired by the calibration officer hits the calibration zone or below and the popper does not fall, the popper is deemed to have failed and the competitor must be ordered to reshoot the course of fire, once the popper has been recalibrated.    (c) if the first shot fired by the calibration officer misses the popper altogether, another shot must be fired until one of 7(a) or 7(b) occurs.    8. stop plates must be calibrated for sensitivity prior to the commencement of a match and tested at regular intervals during the match.
